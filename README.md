# Gastric-intestinal-metaplasia-AI

Gastric intestinal metaplasia (GIM) is recognized as a precancerous lesion of gastric cancer. The current diagnosis of GIM is based on the experience of the physician which is liable to interobserver variability. Consequently, we develop an intelligent diagnostic (ID) system using state-of-the-art CNN architecture to provide objective assistance in the gastroscopy diagnosis of GIM.
