# Gastric-intestinal-metaplasia-AI

## Intelligent diagnosis of gastric intestinal metaplasia based on convolutional neural network and limited number of endoscopic images

## Project introtuction
Gastric intestinal metaplasia (GIM) is recognized as a precancerous lesion of gastric cancer. The current diagnosis of GIM is based on the experience of the physician which is liable to interobserver variability. Consequently, we develop an intelligent diagnostic (ID) system using state-of-the-art CNN architecture to provide objective assistance in the gastroscopy diagnosis of GIM.

## Building models
Three binary classifiers (classifier zero, NBI classifier and M-NBI classifier) with the same CNN architecture based on NBI images and M-NBI images are independently constructed and then combined as the proposed ID system.Please refer to Classifier_Zero.py, M-NBI Classifier.py and NBI Classifier.py for more details.
